        <h2>THE START</h2>
        <p>Nobody could ever narrate my journey to succes better than myself.allow me to take you right back to where it all began.
            I am almost 100% sure that i am a reincarnate, either of my Dad's mum because they were pretty close and my grandmother passed on and was burried
            when my dad was away, so she did not get the chance to bid her son goodbye. I always feel like i have lived in the seventies with my Dad so who knows, i came 
            to be with my son but like his daughter. See and my "lil son" is now themost successful of my kids.
